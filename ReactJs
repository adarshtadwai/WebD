React is a JavaScript library. It is not a framework. It is sophisticated in creating user Interfaces. 
Difference between Framework and Library :- 
The key difference between a library and a framework is "Inversion of Control".
we can think of a library as a certain function of an application, a framework as the skeleton of the application, 
and an API is connector to put those together. A typical development process normally starts with a framework, 
and fill out functions defined in libraries through API.
React is declarative : Tell React what we want to do and it will take care of how we want to do.
